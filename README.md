#Re-Underscore
Underscore is an expansive JavaScript library that abstracts dozens of incredibly useful processes into easy-to-use functions. By nature, these functions are stored as methods in an object saved as the _ property on the global window object.

While being able to use underscore will make you a stronger programmer, knowing exactly how each of these functions are put together will enhance your understanding not just of functions, but also the objects, Booleans, and other data types you use already. This is a library complete with a testing suite to help you hone your chops.
